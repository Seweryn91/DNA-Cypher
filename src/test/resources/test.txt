This is a sample text file.
It's purpose is to check if encoder/decoder works correctly.
It would be nice if it included some alphanumeric characters like an alphabet:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. The other thing could be numbers 0123456789.
How about some extra characters?
Let's go with exclamation mark!
Maybe some @ at this file with a sprinkle of **asterixes* and percentage % of carets ^, and (brackets).
This +/- that = :) ;
